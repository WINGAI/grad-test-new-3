          question: "Can IELTS be waived to get admission to the University?",
          answer: "Though IELTS can be waived sometimes by the university if the year 12 English language score is more than 70%, it is better to do language proficiency test like IELTS or PTE as the top end universities would want these scores. In some cases the university may have their own test. Eg: ARU and DMU"
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need GMAT for a Master's programme in the UK?",

          question: "Should I choose a university based on ranking alone or are there other ways to choose?",

          answer: "Full-time international students are allowed to work 20 hours part-time during the term period and 40 hours or full-time during vacations. On average, a student is paid a minimum of 7-10 pounds per hour."
        },

          question: "Is a sandwich course better than a three years UG course?",
          answer: "The Industrial Experience year enables you to gain relevant industrial experience as part of your studies by usually spending your third year working for a company.

        },
        {
          question: "Is an Interview mandatory while filing my Visa?",

        },
        {
          question: "Will I have to pay for medical treatment in the UK?",
          answer: "The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK provides free and subsidized health care to international students if their Course is over 6 months."
        },
        {

They last from six months to a year and teach you a variety of subjects, including the one you plan to study – English, study skills, research and more. They are sometimes called foundation, diploma or pre-masters courses as well. They can be studied in the UK or in India as well."
          },

            question: "How many hours do I need to go to class?",
            answer: "Usually 15–18 hours per week are allocated for classroom teaching. Apart from that, library research, tutorials and assignments too have to be scheduled into your timetable."
          },
          {
            question: "Are entrance exams required for UK Universities?",
            answer: "Most of the courses don’t require any test as British universities accept the Indian academic marks, but a few professional courses like LLB and Medicine require tests like LNAT and UKCAT respectively. GMAT too is only required for MBA or Masters in certain universities."
          },
          {
            question: "Are universities that require LNAT better than those that don't?",
            answer: "The universities that require LNAT are more competitive and get a lot more applications than the others. The test is more of a filter rather than a sign of being better."
          },
          {
            question: "How important are sports and extracurricular activities for admission to a UK university?",
            answer: "The academic grades are the most important criteria of admission to a British university. Sports and extracurricular activities better your profile in comparison to others, especially for scholarships, Job Interviews etc. There are a few scholarships which you will be eligible for based on the sport played. Eg: Cardiff"
          },
          {
            question: "How long does it take to get a student visa?",
            answer: "As long as the paperwork is in order it should take about 15 working days. Students in Bangalore can file a priority visa which normally takes 5 working days. It costs Rs 10,000 extra. This facility is only available in Bangalore."
          },
          {
            question: "How are scholarships awarded?",
            answer: "Scholarships are usually merit-based. So the first criterion is academic marks. You have to have an offer from the university which you need to accept. Most scholarships require you to write an essay on a given topic, and some may have an interview as well. Your CV should stand out as scholarships are very competitive."
