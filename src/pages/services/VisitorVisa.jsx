              A visitor visa, also known as Temporary Resident Visa, is
              necessitated for different purposes â€” ranging from a visit to
              friends and family to a business-related visit or even something
              as simple as a vacation. This particular kind of visa is stamped
              on your passport.

              Moreover, it must be noted that only some countries offer visas on
              arrival, while most of the countries mandate that the visa be
              obtained before traveling to them. Besides, visitors are strictly
              prohibited from undertaking any sort of profession. However, a
              visit visa grants you to freely explore the landscape of the
              country and tourist destinations.
