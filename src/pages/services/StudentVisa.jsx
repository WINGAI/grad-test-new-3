            Anyone in pursuit of international education is well aware of the
            extremely crucial event â€” Student Visa processing. A foreign
            national wishing to pursue higher education must acquire that
            particular country&apos;s Study Permit/Student Visa in order to gain
            a higher education in that nation.

                Student Visa, an official document, is issued by the Visa
                Officer from the High Commission Embassy. Student Visa is an
                interim document, meaning it permits the foreign national to
                study in that country only for the duration of their education.
                Attainment of their graduation marks the end of their stay,
                after which they must return to their home country.

                The candidates can apply for the Student Permit Visa after
                procuring a Letter of Acceptance provided by the
                university/college they have been admitted to.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this scenario, the university or college Acceptance Letter
                will serve as the student&apos;s official documentation when
                applying for the Study Permit through the country&apos;s
                citizenship and immigration commission.
