              As soon as the student receives his or her visa, the candidate
              prepares to fly abroad to the country of choice to further his or
              her education credentials. Our pre-departure event (Zindagi naa
              milegi dobara) is a very useful session for students as it
              provides them all the necessary information to make their living
              in a foreign country a relatively easy affair.{" "}

              A pre-departure event is offered to students who have their
              student visa approved by the embassy and their passports attested
              with the same. Our event gives the students a fair idea of where
              to start their planning process for the long-awaited journey.{" "}

              The pre-departure event gives an insight into what to expect in
              the country of study. These are things that could make moving and
              settling into a new country comfortable & enjoyable.{" "}

            <p>
              Before each intake, Graduate Consultancy will arrange a
              pre-departure orientation for students who are looking to travel
              to their respective countries. This is a great opportunity for
              students to network with other students who have chosen the same
              country, university, and course. We are here to provide our
              students with A-Z guidance about the country (the country that
              they will be traveling to), its culture, dos and donâ€™ts that need
              to be strictly followed by the students, and so on.{" "}
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
              This information will help students to prepare mentally and
              physically for the new opportunities that await them in their
              respective universities and the countries that they are traveling
              to.
